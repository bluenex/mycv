# Titipat Curriculum Vitae

LaTeX files for Curriculum Vitae with [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
This repository already includes font awesome in the folder `fonts/FontAwesome.otf` and  Thai  Sarabun fonts in `th`.

- `main` for English CV
- `th` for Thai CV

## Walk through using ShareLaTeX

- Compiler that we use is [XeLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/XeLaTeX). XeLaTeX provides
library to import new fonts and compile font awesome.
If you use [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com), start the project then change compiler to `XeLaTeX` by
going to `Menu > Compiler > XeLaTeX`
- Put every files on the repository to `ShareLaTeX` or you can also link ShareLaTeX to Github repository in upgraded account.
- Now, we can use icon by adding `\faIconName` in our LaTeX file e.g. `\faGithubAlt`, `\faEnvelopeO`.
See more fonts available in `fontawesome.sty` (thanks [latex-fontawesome](https://github.com/furl/latex-fontawesome)!)
